This repository serves as a technical resource for tracking the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the **LMSYS Chatbot Arena**. We provide historical ELO data, category-specific breakdowns, and analysis of model performance shifts.

## 📊 Current Top Models (Updated Feb 23, 2026)
Based on the latest human-preference Elo ratings. Note that the 1500+ Elo barrier has officially been broken by "Thinking" class models.

| Rank | Model Name | Arena Elo | Primary Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Claude Opus 4.6 (Thinking)** | **1506 ±10** | Logic & Complex Coding |
| **2** | **Gemini 3.1 Pro** | **1505 ±9** | Multimodal & Live Search |
| **3** | **Gemini 3 Pro** | **1486 ±4** | General Versatility & Context |
| **4** | **Grok-4.1 (Thinking)** | **1475 ±4** | Real-time X Intelligence |
| **5** | **GPT-5.1 High** | **1457 ±4** | Mathematics & Hard Science |



## 🛠️ Why This Leaderboard Matters in 2026
Standard benchmarks like MMLU are becoming "saturated" as models are trained on the test data. The LMSYS Arena remains the gold standard because:
* **Human Preference:** It utilizes over 1.5M blind side-by-side human preference votes.
* **Dynamic Testing:** Users provide real-world, unpredictable prompts that are significantly harder to "memorize."
* **Elo System:** It uses the **Bradley-Terry model** to calculate statistically significant rankings based on pairwise comparisons.

## 📂 Data Access
You can access the raw historical data used for these benchmarks in our open dataset:

> ### 🚨 **Warning: The Elo Inflation Gap**
> In early 2026, we have observed significant "Elo Inflation." Models that scored 1300 in late 2025 are now considered "Mid-Tier." For enterprise-grade automation, we recommend only deploying models with a verified Arena Elo of **1450+**.
