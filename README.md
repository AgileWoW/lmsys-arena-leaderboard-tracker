A 2026 historical tracker and data analysis tool for the LMSYS Chatbot Arena ELO ratings, including coding and reasoning sub-categories.


# 🏆 LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard Tracker (2026)

This repository serves as a technical resource for tracking the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the **LMSYS Chatbot Arena**. We provide historical ELO data, category-specific breakdowns, and analysis of model performance shifts.

## 📊 Current Top Models (Feb 2026)
Based on the latest human-preference Elo ratings from [lmarena.ai](https://lmarena.ai/).

| Rank | Model Name | Elo Rating | Category Strengths |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Gemini 3 Pro** | 1345+ | Multimodal, Logic |
| **2** | **GPT-5.1** | 1338 | Coding, Reasoning |
| **3** | **DeepSeek R1** | 1320 | Math, Open-Source ROI |
| **4** | **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**| 1315 | Creative Writing, Nuance |

### 📂 Data Access
You can access the raw historical data used for these benchmarks in our open dataset:

## 🛠️ Why This Leaderboard Matters in 2026
Standard benchmarks like MMLU are becoming "saturated" as models are trained on the test data. The LMSYS Arena remains the gold standard because:
* **Human Preference:** It uses over 1.5M blind side-by-side human votes.
* **Dynamic Testing:** Users provide real-world, unpredictable prompts that are harder to "memorize".
* **Elo System:** It uses the Bradley-Terry model to calculate statistically significant rankings.

## 📖 Deep Dive & Category Analysis
For a complete analysis of how these ELO scores translate to real-world business ROI and which model you should actually subscribe to, see our master report:

### What is covered in the full guide:
* **Coding Leaderboard:** Which model actually writes better Python?
* **Cost vs. Performance:** Is a higher Elo worth a 10x API price tag?
* **Local LLM Performance:** How DeepSeek R1 is disrupting the top tier.
